An attempt to implement the group 3 fax protocol as defined in ITU [T.4](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.4/en) and [T.30](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.30/en).

Initially the core algorithm will be coded in Julia, but the goal is to make an Android app capable of sending and receiving fax messages using the minimum protocol.
